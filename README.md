# CS201-Computer-Systems-Programming-prog-2

Description:

You are provided with a complete solution of the CRC-8 algorithm in C containing the Fast CRC-8
algorithm in crc.c and a main function that takes as parameter a string in the command line with the
message and calls CRCInit() and CRCFast().
Your job in this assignment is to write a replacement of CRCInit() and CRCFast() in assembly (crca1.S).
The main C function provided in hw3.c should be able to link to the new object file assembled
(crca1.o).
